class Puppet::Resource::Catalog::StaticCompiler < Puppet::Resource::Catalog::Compiler

  desc %q{Compiles catalogs on demand using the optional static compiler. This
    functions similarly to the normal compiler, but it replaces puppet:/// file
    URLs with explicit metadata and file content hashes, expecting puppet agent
    to fetch the exact specified content from the filebucket. This guarantees
    that a given catalog will always result in the same file states. It also
    decreases catalog application time and fileserver load, at the cost of
    increased compilation time.

    This terminus works today, but cannot be used without additional
    configuration. Specifically:

    * You must create a special filebucket resource --- with the title `puppet`
      and the `path` attribute set to `false` --- in site.pp or somewhere else
      where it will be added to every node's catalog. Using `puppet` as the title
      is mandatory; the static compiler treats this title as magical.

          filebucket { puppet:
            path => false,
          }

    * You must set `catalog_terminus = static_compiler` in the puppet
      master's puppet.conf.
    * The puppet master's auth.conf must allow authenticated nodes to access the
      `file_bucket_file` endpoint. This is enabled by default (see the
      `path /file` rule), but if you have made your auth.conf more restrictive,
      you may need to re-enable it.)
    * If you are using multiple puppet masters, you must configure load balancer
      affinity for agent nodes. This is because puppet masters other than the one
      that compiled a given catalog may not have stored the required file contents
      in their filebuckets.}
