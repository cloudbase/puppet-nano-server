# Loader
# ===
# A Loader is responsible for loading "entities" ("instantiable and executable objects in the puppet language" which
# are type, hostclass, definition, function, and bindings.
#
# The main method for users of a Loader is the `load` or `load_typed methods`, which returns a previously loaded entity
# of a given type/name, and searches and loads the entity if not already loaded.
#
# private entities
# ---
# TODO: handle loading of entities that are private. Suggest that all calls pass an origin_loader (the loader
# where request originated (or symbol :public). A module loader has one (or possibly a list) of what is
# considered to represent private loader - i.e. the dependency loader for a module. If an entity is private
# it should be stored with this status, and an error should be raised if the origin_loader is not on the list
# of accepted "private" loaders.
# The private loaders can not be given at creation time (they are parented by the loader in question). Another
# alternative is to check if the origin_loader is a child loader, but this requires bidirectional links
# between loaders or a search if loader with private entity is a parent of the origin_loader).
