# Functions in the puppet language can be written in Ruby and distributed in
# puppet modules. The function is written by creating a file in the module's
# `lib/puppet/functions/<modulename>` directory, where `<modulename>` is
# replaced with the module's name. The file should have the name of the function.
# For example, to create a function named `min` in a module named `math` create
# a file named `lib/puppet/functions/math/min.rb` in the module.
#
# A function is implemented by calling {Puppet::Functions.create_function}, and
# passing it a block that defines the implementation of the function.
#
# Functions are namespaced inside the module that contains them. The name of
# the function is prefixed with the name of the module. For example,
# `math::min`.
#
# @example A simple function
#   Puppet::Functions.create_function('math::min') do
#     def min(a, b)
#       a <= b ? a : b
#     end
#   end
#
# Anatomy of a function
# ---
#
# Functions are composed of four parts: the name, the implementation methods,
# the signatures, and the dispatches.
#
# The name is the string given to the {Puppet::Functions.create_function}
# method. It specifies the name to use when calling the function in the puppet
# language, or from other functions.
#
# The implementation methods are ruby methods (there can be one or more) that
# provide that actual implementation of the function's behavior. In the
# simplest case the name of the function (excluding any namespace) and the name
# of the method are the same. When that is done no other parts (signatures and
# dispatches) need to be used.
#
# Signatures are a way of specifying the types of the function's parameters.
# The types of any arguments will be checked against the types declared in the
# signature and an error will be produced if they don't match. The types are
# defined by using the same syntax for types as in the puppet language.
#
# Dispatches are how signatures and implementation methods are tied together.
# When the function is called, puppet searches the signatures for one that
# matches the supplied arguments. Each signature is part of a dispatch, which
# specifies the method that should be called for that signature. When a
# matching signature is found, the corrosponding method is called.
#
# Documentation for the function should be placed as comments to the
# implementation method(s).
#
# @todo Documentation for individual instances of these new functions is not
#   yet tied into the puppet doc system.
#
# @example Dispatching to different methods by type
#   Puppet::Functions.create_function('math::min') do
#     dispatch :numeric_min do
#       param 'Numeric', :a
#       param 'Numeric', :b
#     end
#
#     dispatch :string_min do
#       param 'String', :a
#       param 'String', :b
#     end
#
#     def numeric_min(a, b)
#       a <= b ? a : b
#     end
#
#     def string_min(a, b)
#       a.downcase <= b.downcase ? a : b
#     end
#   end
#
# Specifying Signatures
# ---
#
# If nothing is specified, the number of arguments given to the function must
# be the same as the number of parameters, and all of the parameters are of
# type 'Any'.
#
# The following methods can be used to define a parameter
#
#  - _param_ - the argument must be given in the call.
#  - _optional_param_ - the argument may be missing in the call. May not be followed by a required parameter
#  - _repeated_param_ - the type specifies a repeating type that occurs 0 to "infinite" number of times. It may only appear last or just before a block parameter.
#  - _block_param_ - a block must be given in the call. May only appear last.
#  - _optional_block_param_ - a block may be given in the call. May only appear last.
#
# The method name _required_param_ is an alias for _param_ and _required_block_param_ is an alias for _block_param_
#
# A parameter definition takes 2 arguments:
#  - _type_ A string that must conform to a type in the puppet language
#  - _name_ A symbol denoting the parameter name
#
# Both arguments are optional when defining a block parameter. The _type_ defaults to "Callable"
# and the _name_ to :block.
#
# Note that the dispatch definition is used to match arguments given in a call to the function with the defined
# parameters. It then dispatches the call to the implementation method simply passing the given arguments on to
# that method without any further processing and it is the responsibility of that method's implementor to ensure
# that it can handle those arguments.
#
# @example Variable number of arguments
#   Puppet::Functions.create_function('foo') do
#     dispatch :foo do
#       param 'Numeric', :first
#       repeated_param 'Numeric', :values
#     end
#
#     def foo(first, *values)
#       # do something
#     end
#   end
#
# There is no requirement for direct mapping between parameter definitions and the parameters in the
# receiving implementation method so the following example is also legal. Here the dispatch will ensure
# that `*values` in the receiver will be an array with at least one entry of type String and that any
# remaining entries are of type Numeric:
#
# @example Inexact mapping or parameters
#   Puppet::Functions.create_function('foo') do
#     dispatch :foo do
#       param 'String', :first
#       repeated_param 'Numeric', :values
#     end
#
#     def foo(*values)
#       # do something
#     end
#   end
#
# Access to Scope
# ---
# In general, functions should not need access to scope; they should be
# written to act on their given input only. If they absolutely must look up
# variable values, they should do so via the closure scope (the scope where
# they are defined) - this is done by calling `closure_scope()`.
#
# Calling other Functions
# ---
# Calling other functions by name is directly supported via
# {Puppet::Pops::Functions::Function#call_function}. This allows a function to
# call other functions visible from its loader.

  # Injection of attributes is performed by one of the methods `attr_injected`,

  #
  # Injection and Weaving of parameters
  # ---
  # It is possible to inject and weave parameters into a call. These extra
  # parameters are not part of the parameters passed from the Puppet logic, and
  # they can not be overridden by parameters given as arguments in the call.
  # They are invisible to the Puppet Language.
  #
  # @example using injected parameters
  #   Puppet::Functions.create_function('test') do
  #     dispatch :test do
  #       param 'Scalar', 'a'
  #       param 'Scalar', 'b'
  #       injected_param 'String', 'larger', 'message_larger'
  #       injected_param 'String', 'smaller', 'message_smaller'
  #     end
  #     def test(a, b, larger, smaller)
  #       a > b ? larger : smaller
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # The function in the example above is called like this:
  #
  #     test(10, 20)
  #
  # Using injected value as default
  # ---
  # Default value assignment is handled by using the regular Ruby mechanism (a
  # value is assigned to the variable).  The dispatch simply indicates that the
  # value is optional. If the default value should be injected, it can be
  # handled different ways depending on what is desired:
  #
  # * by calling the accessor method for an injected Function class attribute.
  #   This is suitable if the value is constant across all instantiations of the
  #   function, and across all calls.
  # * by injecting a parameter into the call
  #   to the left of the parameter, and then assigning that as the default value.
  # * One of the above forms, but using an injected producer instead of a
  #   directly injected value.
  #
  # @example method with injected default values
  #   Puppet::Functions.create_function('test') do
  #     dispatch :test do
  #       injected_param String, 'b_default', 'b_default_value_key'
  #       param 'Scalar', 'a'
  #       param 'Scalar', 'b'
  #     end
