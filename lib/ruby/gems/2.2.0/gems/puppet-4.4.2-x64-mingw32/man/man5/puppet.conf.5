.SH "Configuration Settings"
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Each of these settings can be specified in \fBpuppet\.conf\fR or on the command line\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When using boolean settings on the command line, use \fB\-\-setting\fR and \fB\-\-no\-setting\fR instead of \fB\-\-setting (true|false)\fR\. (Using \fB\-\-setting false\fR results in "Error: Could not parse application options: needless argument"\.)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Settings can be interpolated as \fB$variables\fR in other settings; \fB$environment\fR is special, in that puppet master will interpolate each agent node\'s environment instead of its own\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Multiple values should be specified as comma\-separated lists; multiple directories should be separated with the system path separator (usually a colon)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Settings that represent time intervals should be specified in duration format: an integer immediately followed by one of the units \'y\' (years of 365 days), \'d\' (days), \'h\' (hours), \'m\' (minutes), or \'s\' (seconds)\. The unit cannot be combined with other units, and defaults to seconds when omitted\. Examples are \'3600\' which is equivalent to \'1h\' (one hour), and \'1825d\' which is equivalent to \'5y\' (5 years)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Settings that take a single file or directory can optionally set the owner, group, and mode for their value: \fBrundir = $vardir/run { owner = puppet, group = puppet, mode = 644 }\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The Puppet executables will ignore any setting that isn\'t relevant to their function\.
.
.IP "" 0

.P
See the configuration guide \fIhttps://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/guides/configuring\.html\fR for more details\.
.
.SS "agent_catalog_run_lockfile"
A lock file to indicate that a puppet agent catalog run is currently in progress\. The file contains the pid of the process that holds the lock on the catalog run\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIDefault\fR: $statedir/agent_catalog_run\.lock
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "agent_disabled_lockfile"
A lock file to indicate that puppet agent runs have been administratively disabled\. File contains a JSON object with state information\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIDefault\fR: $statedir/agent_disabled\.lock
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "allow_duplicate_certs"
Whether to allow a new certificate request to overwrite an existing certificate\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIDefault\fR: false
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "always_cache_features"
Affects how we cache attempts to load Puppet \'features\'\. If false, then calls to \fBPuppet\.features\.<feature>?\fR will always attempt to load the feature (which can be an expensive operation) unless it has already been loaded successfully\. This makes it possible for a single agent run to, e\.g\., install a package that provides the underlying capabilities for a feature, and then later load that feature during the same run (even if the feature had been tested earlier and had not been available)\.
.
.P
If this setting is set to true, then features will only be checked once, and if they are not available, the negative result is cached and returned for all subsequent attempts to load the feature\. This behavior is almost always appropriate for the server, and can result in a significant performance improvement for features that are checked frequently\.

\fIDefault\fR: true
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "autosign"
Whether (and how) to autosign certificate requests\. This setting is only relevant on a puppet master acting as a certificate authority (CA)\.
.
.P
Valid values are true (autosigns all certificate requests; not recommended), false (disables autosigning certificates), or the absolute path to a file\.
.
.P
The file specified in this setting may be either a \fBconfiguration file\fR or a \fBcustom policy executable\.\fR Puppet will automatically determine what it is: If the Puppet user (see the \fBuser\fR setting) can execute the file, it will be treated as a policy executable; otherwise, it will be treated as a config file\.
.
.P
If a custom policy executable is configured, the CA puppet master will run it every time it receives a CSR\. The executable will be passed the subject CN of the request \fIas a command line argument,\fR and the contents of the CSR in PEM format \fIon stdin\.\fR It should exit with a status of 0 if the cert should be autosigned and non\-zero if the cert should not be autosigned\.
.
.P
If a certificate request is not autosigned, it will persist for review\. An admin user can use the \fBpuppet cert sign\fR command to manually sign it, or can delete the request\.
.
.P
For info on autosign configuration files, see the guide to Puppet\'s config files \fIhttps://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/guides/configuring\.html\fR\.

.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIDefault\fR: true
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "certname"
The name to use when handling certificates\. When a node requests a certificate from the CA puppet master, it uses the value of the \fBcertname\fR setting as its requested Subject CN\.
.
.P
This is the name used when managing a node\'s permissions in auth\.conf \fIhttps://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/puppet/latest/reference/config_file_auth\.html\fR\. In most cases, it is also used as the node\'s name when matching node definitions \fIhttps://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_node_definitions\.html\fR and requesting data from an ENC\. (This can be changed with the \fBnode_name_value\fR and \fBnode_name_fact\fR settings, although you should only do so if you have a compelling reason\.)
.
.P
A node\'s certname is available in Puppet manifests as \fB$trusted[\'certname\']\fR\. (See Facts and Built\-In Variables \fIhttps://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_facts_and_builtin_vars\.html\fR for more details\.)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
For best compatibility, you should limit the value of \fBcertname\fR to only use letters, numbers, periods, underscores, and dashes\. (That is, it should match \fB/A[a\-z0\-9\._\-]+Z/\fR\.)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The special value \fBca\fR is reserved, and can\'t be used as the certname for a normal node\.

.IP "" 0
.
.SS "code"
Code to parse directly\. This is essentially only used by \fBpuppet\fR, and should only be set if you\'re writing your own Puppet executable\.
.
.SS "codedir"
The main Puppet code directory\. The default for this setting is calculated based on the user\. If the process is running as root or the user that Puppet is supposed to run as, it defaults to a system directory, but if it\'s running as any other user, it defaults to being in the user\'s home directory\.
.
.TP
\fIDefault\fR:

.
.SS "color"
Whether to use colors when logging to the console\. Valid values are \fBansi\fR (equivalent to \fBtrue\fR), \fBhtml\fR, and \fBfalse\fR, which produces no color\. Defaults to false on Windows, as its console does not support ansi colors\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIDefault\fR: ansi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "confdir"
The main Puppet configuration directory\. The default for this setting is calculated based on the user\. If the process is running as root or the user that Puppet is supposed to run as, it defaults to a system directory, but if it\'s running as any other user, it defaults to being in the user\'s home directory\.

\fIDefault\fR: puppet\.conf
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "config_version"
How to determine the configuration version\. By default, it will be the time that the configuration is parsed, but you can provide a shell script to override how the version is determined\. The output of this script will be added to every log message in the reports, allowing you to correlate changes on your hosts to the source version on the server\.
.
.P
Setting a global value for config_version in puppet\.conf is not allowed (but it can be overridden from the commandline)\. Please set a per\-environment value in environment\.conf instead\. For more info, see https://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/puppet/latest/reference/environments\.html
.
.SS "configprint"
Print the value of a specific configuration setting\. If the name of a setting is provided for this, then the value is printed and puppet exits\. Comma\-separate multiple values\. For a list of all values, specify \'all\'\.
.
.SS "configtimeout"
How long the client should wait for the configuration to be retrieved before considering it a failure\. This setting is deprecated and has been replaced by http_connect_timeout and http_read_timeout\. This setting can be a time interval in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes (30m), hours (6h), days (2d), or years (5y)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIDefault\fR: 2m
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "csr_attributes"
An optional file containing custom attributes to add to certificate signing requests (CSRs)\. You should ensure that this file does not exist on your CA puppet master; if it does, unwanted certificate extensions may leak into certificates created with the \fBpuppet cert generate\fR command\.
.
.P
If present, this file must be a YAML hash containing a \fBcustom_attributes\fR key and/or an \fBextension_requests\fR key\. The value of each key must be a hash, where each key is a valid OID and each value is an object that can be cast to a string\.
.
.P
Custom attributes can be used by the CA when deciding whether to sign the certificate, but are then discarded\. Attribute OIDs can be any OID value except the standard CSR attributes (i\.e\. attributes described in RFC 2985 section 5\.4)\. This is useful for embedding a pre\-shared key for autosigning policy executables (see the \fBautosign\fR setting), often by using the \fB1\.2\.840\.113549\.1\.9\.7\fR ("challenge password") OID\.
.
.P
Extension requests will be permanently embedded in the final certificate\. Extension OIDs must be in the "ppRegCertExt" (\fB1\.3\.6\.1\.4\.1\.34380\.1\.1\fR) or "ppPrivCertExt" (\fB1\.3\.6\.1\.4\.1\.34380\.1\.2\fR) OID arcs\. The ppRegCertExt arc is reserved for four of the most common pieces of data to embed: \fBpp_uuid\fR (\fB\.1\fR), \fBpp_instance_id\fR (\fB\.2\fR), \fBpp_image_name\fR (\fB\.3\fR), and \fBpp_preshared_key\fR (\fB\.4\fR) \-\-\- in the YAML file, these can be referred to by their short descriptive names instead of their full OID\. The ppPrivCertExt arc is unregulated, and can be used for site\-specific extensions\.

The default main manifest for directory environments\. Any environment that doesn\'t set the \fBmanifest\fR setting in its \fBenvironment\.conf\fR file will use this manifest\.
.
.P
This setting\'s value can be an absolute or relative path\. An absolute path will make all environments default to the same main manifest; a relative path will allow each environment to use its own manifest, and Puppet will resolve the path relative to each environment\'s main directory\.

.SS "disable_per_environment_manifest"
Whether to disallow an environment\-specific main manifest\. When set to \fBtrue\fR, Puppet will use the manifest specified in the \fBdefault_manifest\fR setting for all environments\. If an environment specifies a different main manifest in its \fBenvironment\.conf\fR file, catalog requests for that environment will fail with an error\.

.SS "disable_warnings"
A comma\-separated list of warning types to suppress\. If large numbers of warnings are making Puppet\'s logs too large or difficult to use, you can temporarily silence them with this setting\.

.SS "dns_alt_names"
The comma\-separated list of alternative DNS names to use for the local host\.
.
.P
When the node generates a CSR for itself, these are added to the request as the desired \fBsubjectAltName\fR in the certificate: additional DNS labels that the certificate is also valid answering as\.
.
.P
This is generally required if you use a non\-hostname \fBcertname\fR, or if you want to use \fBpuppet kick\fR or \fBpuppet resource \-H\fR and the primary certname does not match the DNS name you use to communicate with the host\.
.
.P
This is unnecessary for agents, unless you intend to use them as a server for \fBpuppet kick\fR or remote \fBpuppet resource\fR management\.
.
.P
It is rarely necessary for servers; it is usually helpful only if you need to have a pool of multiple load balanced masters, or for the same master to respond on two physically separate networks under different names\.

.SS "environment"
The environment Puppet is running in\. For clients (e\.g\., \fBpuppet agent\fR) this determines the environment itself, which is used to find modules and much more\. For servers (i\.e\., \fBpuppet master\fR) this provides the default environment for nodes we know nothing about\.

How long the Puppet master should cache data it loads from an environment\. This setting can be a time interval in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes (30m), hours (6h), days (2d), or years (5y)\. A value of \fB0\fR will disable caching\. This setting can also be set to \fBunlimited\fR, which will cache environments until the master is restarted or told to refresh the cache\.
.
.P
You should change this setting once your Puppet deployment is doing non\-trivial work\. We chose the default value of \fB0\fR because it lets new users update their code without any extra steps, but it lowers the performance of your Puppet master\.
.
.P
We recommend setting this to \fBunlimited\fR and explicitly refreshing your Puppet master as part of your code deployment process\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
With Puppet Server, you should refresh environments by calling the \fBenvironment\-cache\fR API endpoint\. See the docs for the Puppet Server administrative API\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
With a Rack Puppet master, you should restart the web server or the application server\. Passenger lets you touch a \fBrestart\.txt\fR file to refresh an application without restarting Apache; see the Passenger docs for details\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
We don\'t recommend using any value other than \fB0\fR or \fBunlimited\fR, since most Puppet masters use a pool of Ruby interpreters which all have their own cache timers\. When these timers drift out of sync, agents can be served inconsistent catalogs\.

The list of report handlers to use\. When using multiple report handlers, their names should be comma\-separated, with whitespace allowed\. (For example, \fBreports = http, store\fR\.)
.
.P
This setting is relevant to puppet master and puppet apply\. The puppet master will call these report handlers with the reports it receives from agent nodes, and puppet apply will call them with its own report\. (In all cases, the node applying the catalog must have \fBreport = true\fR\.)
.

.SS "waitforcert"
How frequently puppet agent should ask for a signed certificate\.
.
.P
When starting for the first time, puppet agent will submit a certificate signing request (CSR) to the server named in the \fBca_server\fR setting (usually the puppet master); this may be autosigned, or may need to be approved by a human, depending on the CA server\'s configuration\.
.
.P
Puppet agent cannot apply configurations until its approved certificate is available\. Since the certificate may or may not be available immediately, puppet agent will repeatedly try to fetch it at this interval\. You can turn off waiting for certificates by specifying a time of 0, in which case puppet agent will exit if it cannot get a cert\. This setting can be a time interval in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes (30m), hours (6h), days (2d), or years (5y)\.
