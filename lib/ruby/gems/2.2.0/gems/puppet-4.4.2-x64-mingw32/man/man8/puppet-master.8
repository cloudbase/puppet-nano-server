.SH "NAME"
\fBpuppet\-master\fR \- The puppet master daemon
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
The central puppet server\. Functions as a certificate authority by default\.
.
.SH "USAGE"
puppet master [\-D|\-\-daemonize|\-\-no\-daemonize] [\-d|\-\-debug] [\-h|\-\-help] [\-l|\-\-logdest syslog|\fIFILE\fR|console] [\-v|\-\-verbose] [\-V|\-\-version] [\-\-compile \fINODE\-NAME\fR]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command starts an instance of puppet master, running as a daemon and using Ruby\'s built\-in Webrick webserver\. Puppet master can also be managed by other application servers; when this is the case, this executable is not used\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that any Puppet setting that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument\. For example, \'server\' is a valid setting, so you can specify \'\-\-server \fIservername\fR\' as an argument\. Boolean settings translate into \'\-\-setting\' and \'\-\-no\-setting\' pairs\.
.
.P
See the configuration file documentation at https://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/references/stable/configuration\.html for the full list of acceptable settings\. A commented list of all settings can also be generated by running puppet master with \'\-\-genconfig\'\.
.
.TP
\-\-daemonize
Send the process into the background\. This is the default\. (This is a Puppet setting, and can go in puppet\.conf\. Note the special \'no\-\' prefix for boolean settings on the command line\.)
.
.TP
\-\-no\-daemonize
Do not send the process into the background\. (This is a Puppet setting, and can go in puppet\.conf\. Note the special \'no\-\' prefix for boolean settings on the command line\.)
.
.TP
\-\-debug
Enable full debugging\.
.
.TP
\-\-help
Print this help message\.
.
.TP
\-\-logdest
Where to send log messages\. Choose between \'syslog\' (the POSIX syslog service), \'console\', or the path to a log file\. If debugging or verbosity is enabled, this defaults to \'console\'\. Otherwise, it defaults to \'syslog\'\.
.
.IP
A path ending with \'\.json\' will receive structured output in JSON format\. The log file will not have an ending \']\' automatically written to it due to the appending nature of logging\. It must be appended manually to make the content valid JSON\.
.
.TP
\-\-masterport
The port on which to listen for traffic\. (This is a Puppet setting, and can go in puppet\.conf\.)
.
.TP
\-\-verbose
Enable verbosity\.
.
.TP
\-\-version
Print the puppet version number and exit\.
.
.TP
\-\-compile
Compile a catalogue and output it in JSON from the puppet master\. Uses facts contained in the $vardir/yaml/ directory to compile the catalog\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLE"

.
.TP
SIGHUP
Restart the puppet master server\.
.
.TP
SIGINT and SIGTERM
