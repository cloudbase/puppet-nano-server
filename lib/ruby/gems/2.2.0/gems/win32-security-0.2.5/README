= Description
  A security library for MS Windows that allows you to open existing or
  create new security identifiers (SID's).

= Synopsis
  require 'win32/security'
  include Win32
   
  sid = Security::SID.open('some_user')
   
  sid.valid? # => true
  sid.to_s   # => "S-1-5-21-3733855671-1102023144-2002619019-1000"
  sid.length # => 28
  sid.sid    # => "\001\005\000\000\000\000\000\005\025\000\000\000..."
   
== Future Plans
  Create classes that encapsulate ACL's, ACE's, Token's, etc.
   
  There are some unfinished versions of the ACL and ACE classes in the
  repo if you're interested in taking a look.
