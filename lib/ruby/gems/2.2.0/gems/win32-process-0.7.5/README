= Description
  This library provides analogues of the :getpriority, :setpriority, :getrlimit,
  :setrlimit and :uid methods for MS Windows. It also adds the new methods :job?,
  :get_affinity, and :create, and redefines the :kill method.
 
= Prerequisites
  * ffi
  * sys-proctable (dev only)
  * test-unit 2 (dev only)

= Supported Platforms
  This library is supported on Windows 2000 or later.

= Installation
  gem install win32-process

= Synopsis
  require 'win32/process'

  p Process.job? # => true or false

  info = Process.create(
    :app_name         => "notepad.exe",
    :creation_flags   => Process::DETACHED_PROCESS,
    :process_inherit  => false,
    :thread_inherit   => true,
    :cwd              => "C:\\"
  )

  p info.process_id
	
= Developer's Notes
== Removal of Process.fork in release 0.7.0
   The Process.fork method was originally experimental but it has never
   been particularly useful in practice. On top of that, it required special
   implementations of the Process.waitXXX methods, so it was a maintenance
   issue as well.
   
   With Ruby 1.9 now becoming standard and its addition of Process.spawn
   and friends (and concomitant support for the Process.waitXXX methods) I
   felt it was time to remove it.

   You can still simulate Process.fork if you like using Process.create, which
   is how it was implemented internally anyway. A better solution might be
   to follow in the footsteps of ActiveState Perl, which uses native threads
   to simulate fork on Windows.
	
== Changes in the custom Process.kill method for 0.7.0
   The Process.kill method in 0.7.0 more closely matches the spec now, but
   the internal method for killing processes is still nicer for most signals.
   With the release of 0.7.0 users can now specify options that provide finer
   control over how a process is killed. See the documentation for details. 

== The removal of the custom Process.ppid method
   This was added at some point in the Ruby 1.9 dev cycle so it was removed
   from this library.

= Known Issues
  JRuby doesn't seem to like SIGBRK for Process.kill.
