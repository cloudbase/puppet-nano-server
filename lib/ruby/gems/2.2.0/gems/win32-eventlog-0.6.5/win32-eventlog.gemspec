    The win32-eventlog library provides an interface to the MS Windows event
    log. Event logging provides a standard, centralized way for applications
    (and the operating system) to record important software and hardware
    events. The event-logging service stores events from various sources in a
    single collection called an event log. This library allows you to inspect
    existing logs as well as create new ones.
